# Federated Learning for 30 Days

Welcome to my 30-day journey into **Federated Learning (FL)**! This repository documents my daily learnings, experiments, and insights as I dive into this exciting domain at the intersection of AI and privacy. üöÄ

## üîç Why Federated Learning?

Federated Learning is a method for training models on decentralized data while ensuring privacy by keeping the data localized on devices. As data privacy becomes increasingly important, technologies like FL offer a promising way to enable powerful AI without compromising user privacy.

This 30-day plan aims to strengthen my understanding of FL through implementation, experimentation, and research.

## üìÖ 30-Day Plan

### Week 1: Foundations and Basics
- **Day 1 (Nov 21):** Implement FedAvg (focus on understanding basic concepts and coding workflow).  
- **Day 2:** Study the foundational paper "Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data" (McMahan et al., 2017). Summarize key takeaways.  
- **Day 3:** Experiment with FedAvg implementation:  
  - Run on synthetic datasets.  
  - Visualize training progress and loss curves.  
- **Day 4:** Learn about the differences between centralized and federated learning. Explore metrics for FL (e.g., communication cost, accuracy trade-offs).  
- **Day 5:** Explore PySyft or Flower for federated learning frameworks.  
- **Day 6:** Understand privacy concerns in FL. Study Differential Privacy basics.  
- **Day 7:** Implement Differential Privacy in your FedAvg model. Document challenges faced.  

### Week 2: Expanding Scope
- **Day 8:** Study Secure Aggregation and cryptographic techniques in FL.  
- **Day 9:** Experiment with a heterogeneous dataset simulation (e.g., different distributions for clients).  
- **Day 10:** Review papers on personalization in FL (e.g., FedPer, cluster-based FL approaches).  
- **Day 11:** Implement a personalization strategy in FedAvg (e.g., fine-tuning client models).  
- **Day 12:** Explore how model heterogeneity affects FL performance (e.g., use different architectures for clients).  
- **Day 13:** Write a blog or journal entry summarizing your Week 2 insights.  
- **Day 14:** Mid-challenge review: List key learnings and gaps. Plan the next steps.  

### Week 3: Applications and Enhancements
- **Day 15:** Study FL applications in healthcare (e.g., FL for medical imaging).  
- **Day 16:** Implement an FL model for an image classification task (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).  
- **Day 17:** Learn about model compression techniques (e.g., quantization) for FL.  
- **Day 18:** Apply quantization to reduce communication costs in FedAvg.  
- **Day 19:** Study FL in edge computing and IoT. Summarize challenges and opportunities.  
- **Day 20:** Experiment with introducing stragglers or client dropouts in FL simulations.  

### Week 4: Advanced Topics and Projects
- **Day 21:** Dive into Federated Learning with Non-IID Data. Read a related paper.  
- **Day 22:** Implement FedProx (or another algorithm designed for non-IID data).  
- **Day 23:** Study adversarial attacks and defenses in FL.  
- **Day 24:** Simulate an adversarial attack on your FL model. Document observations.  
- **Day 25:** Learn about cross-silo vs. cross-device FL scenarios.  
- **Day 26:** Begin a mini-project: Choose an FL scenario, design experiments, and set goals.  
- **Day 27:** Work on your mini-project.  
- **Day 28:** Finalize your mini-project and document results.  
- **Day 29:** Reflect on the challenge: Write a summary report.  
- **Day 30 (Dec 20):** Share your learnings via a blog post, LinkedIn, or GitHub.
